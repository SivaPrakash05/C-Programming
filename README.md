Basic C Programs for Beginners to understand programming concepts

- [Add_using_pointers.c](https://github.com/SivaPrakash05/C-Programming/blob/main/Add_using_pointers.c)  - Program to add three numbers using pointers in C Programming.
- [Armstrong_Number.c](https://github.com/SivaPrakash05/C-Programming/blob/main/Armstrong_Number.c) - Find the given number is an Armstrong number or not.
  - Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.
- [Current Time.c](https://github.com/SivaPrakash05/C-Programming/blob/main/Current%20Time.c)  - Program to display the current time in your system using time_t, time() and ctime().
  -  time_t - type capable of representing times.
  -  time() - returns current calender time as a object of type time_t.
  -  ctime() - returns a string that contains the date and time which is in human readable form.
- [Factorial.c](https://github.com/SivaPrakash05/C-Programming/blob/main/Factorial.c) - Program to find the factorial value of the given number.
  -  Factorial:-<br>The product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer and denoted by that integer and an exclamation point. Thus, factorial seven is written 7!, meaning 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. Factorial zero is defined as equal to 1.
  -  Formula : n! = n × (n−1)
- [Fibonnacci.c](https://github.com/SivaPrakash05/C-Programming/blob/main/Fibonacci.c) - Program to generate fibonacci series to the given number.
  - Fibonacci numbers that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
  - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144. . . . . .
- [Leap Year.c](https://github.com/SivaPrakash05/C-Programming/blob/main/Leap%20Year.c) - Program to Find the Given Year is leap year or not.
  - A normal year has 365 days.
  - A Leap Year has 366 days (the extra day is the 29th of February).
  - [x] Years are any year that can be exactly divided by 4 (such as 2016, 2020, 2024, etc)
  - [x] except if it can be exactly divided by 100, then it isn't (such as 2100, 2200, etc)
  - [x] except if it can be exactly divided by 400, then it is (such as 2000, 2400)
